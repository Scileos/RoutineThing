Potential routine thing

Key concepts
- Built in volume periodisation
- Progressive volume overload via weight/set/rep increases dependent on workout results
- Auto regulation dependent on RPE


Basic workflow

- User is given workout
    - Automatically Generated?
        - Pre made workouts using volume landmarks such as MEV and MAV
        - 4/5/6 day variants
    - Custom inputs?
        - Allow users to create their own workouts from either pre defined exercies or free text inputs
        - They can define expected rep ranges for each exercise this way
        - Potentially limit number of workouts able to store?
- User inputs amount of reps achieved per set
    - Number of reps based on RIR
    - Basic input fields
- Auto calculates next workout
    - Follow current understanding of progressive overload
        - If all sets fall within rep range
            - Increase weight
            - Increase sets
        - Else
            - Increase number of reps
    - Repeat until fatigue becomes unmanageable
        - Basic implmentation
            - 4/5 weeks progression followed by 1 week deload
            - Increase base volume and repeat
        - Advanced implmentation
            - Similar but over a longer period of time, perhaps multiple mesocycles
            - Instead of fixed time, implement deload weak when RPE is too high on average. Or rely on user to manage their fatigue correctly



Technology

- App is clearly the most suitable as allows user to use during workout
- Maybe create logic with basic web UI then port over?
- Front end
    - React
    - Angular
- Back end
    - C# web api
    - NodeJS web api
- Data Persistence
    - If web app, can use SQL database to store user workout information
    - Think about device local storage
